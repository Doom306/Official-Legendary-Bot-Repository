## Welcome to the Official Source Code for `Legendary bot`

You can only use this as educational use. If I notice someone (could be you) simply copy and pasting this not changing < 60% of it will be banned from using my projects and etc.

If you want to use the code you `MUST` create a new `Pull Request` and `wait` until we `confirm` it.

## Version `6.0135`

### This is now the 6.0 version of Legendary Bot

This is the `Legendary Bot 6.0` with simple but complex commands and different structure from `Legendary bot 5.821 (and below)` .
